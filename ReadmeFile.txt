- Introduction to Code Architecture:

I've used python for programming Decision Tree algorithm and used the concept of classes, functions, list/dictionaries, loops in python to achieve this. 

- Data Pruning and Error Handling

I've also done data cleaning and pruning in the steps. for e.g: in case of true and false, i've stored it as string, other special characters are also being handled and converted into strings so that they won't give any error.

- Bonus part Explaination:
I've asked user to input the test data file. Based on the test data file i will generate the tree for test dataset and store the result in a list. I will match the result generated by training and test dataset and compare the result and print the accuracy. But the challenge i faced is to store the data for test set as i've to re-run all the logic for that. which is pending at the moment. I've holded the data but unable to compare the results.

- Overview the program code:
	
  There is one single Python file named as DecisionTree.py


- The following is the  program structure:

   main()---->ask for input
   			---->filename for Training set. [If file doen't exist, you will get a validation error]
   			---->Filename for Test data set [If file doen't exist, you will get a validation error]
   			---->Based on training data set, program will give you the options to select one Target Attribute

   		----> loaddb
   			---->I have used the concept of Dataframe to load and store data in python.

   		---->Find information Gain of Target attribute and select the best attribute as Root node for tree.
            ----> Store the result in a class Infogain_RootNode

   		---->Start Recursion Process
   			----> Find The  best attribute for split [CalculateBestAttributetoSplit() function]
            ----> Calculate Entropy, and Gain.
            ----> Find the childrens by passing the data in Recursion function. [Recursion() function]
            ----> Keeps on repeating untill i get the pure node or no further attributes remaining to split.

   		---->file Write()
   			---->if file exist then delete
   			---->create new file and write
   			
- Run the program:
   	bluenose: python DecisionTree.py
   	
- The result is stored in the file: /users/grad/bhalla/assign4/Output.txt , to view the result:                         
   bluenose: more Output.txt   
- If you want to change the file output path: Open the file in text edittor and change the value for variable "Path".
